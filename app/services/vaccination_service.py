"""Apply a request-level vaccination block to an epydemix model.

Validates the config, resolves the campaign flows (preset defaults vs. user
overrides), pre-computes one schedule per campaign (count-based for
``flat_count``, rate-based for ``fixed_rate``), resolves any coverage caps,
registers the ``vaccination`` transition kind, and adds one transition per
flow that has a non-null target. The simulator then drives doses during
each step according to the resolved schedules.

Mutates ``model`` in place; no-op when the request supplies no
``vaccination`` block or an empty campaign list.
